/**
 * Default score binning approach.
 *
 * The strategy is very simple: pick what appears to be a sensible number of bins given the volume of data. This means
 * that sometimes, we will pick a number of bins that is too small (i.e. less than dimension + 1) because there isn't
 * enough data to support a finer binning strategy.
