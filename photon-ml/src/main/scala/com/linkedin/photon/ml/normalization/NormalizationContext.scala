/**
 * The normalization approach for the optimization problem, especially for generalized linear model. This gives concrete approach for
 * normalization, given the [[NormalizationType]] and the input data.
 *
 * The transformation consists of two part, the factors and the shifts. The transformation of a feature is
 *
 * x -> (x - shift) .* factor
 *
 * where .* is a point wise multiplication.
 *
 * Note that if the shift is enabled, there must be an intercept provided. One typical transformation is the feature standardization,
 * i.e. shifts are feature means the factors are the reciprocal of the feature standard deviations. After feature standardization,
 * the features become zero-mean unit-variance distributed. Normalization is very important in the context of regularization.
 *
 * This class assume that the intercepts for the original and the transformed space are both 1, so the shift for the intercept should be 0,
 * and the factor for the intercept should be 1.
 *
 * Also note that this normalization context class covers all affine transformations without rotation.
