/**
 * A projection map that maintains the one-to-one mapping of indices between the original and projected space
 *
 * This is expected to be used in cases where we are training models on a subset of features so that it would not make
 * sense to deal with vectors of the size of the original dimension.
 *
 * e.g. If one is training a per-item model, the instances in the training set that is used for this task might only
 *      have a small subset of the features active. In such a case, we can train a model in the smaller space for
 *      better efficiency but we need to also map the coefficients back to the original space eventually. This class
 *      does the projection of features to the smaller sub-space as well as projecting the features back to the
 *      original dimensions
 *
 * Given the intended use case, no primary constructor is provided. It can only be constructed via the companion
 * object's builder method
