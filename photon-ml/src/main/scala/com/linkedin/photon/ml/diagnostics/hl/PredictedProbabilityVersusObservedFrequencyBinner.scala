/**
 * Generic interface for binning logistic-regression type responses into a list of (prediction range -> actual counts v
 * expected counts) tuples. It is possible, in the future, that it would make sense to further refine / abstract this
 * class if we think about doing general &Chi;<sup>2</sup> testing or similar goodness-of-fit measures.
 *
 * For now, the major purpose of this class is to allow me to mock this logic out for testing.
