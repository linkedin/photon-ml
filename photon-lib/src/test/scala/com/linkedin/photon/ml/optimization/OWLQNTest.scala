/**
 * Test that OWLQN can shrink the coefficients to zero.
 *
 * The objective function, prior to regularization, had known minimum when all coefficients are 4 (see TestObjective).
 * We are only interested in the behavior around the minimum, where:
 *
 *    x_i > 0 for all i
 *
 * Thus the function to be optimized becomes:
 *
 *    (x_1 - 4)^2 + (x_2 - 4)^2 + ... + L1Weight * Abs(Sum(x_i))
 *
 * which has obvious analytic solution. This test is based on the above function and verifies the shrinkage of x.
